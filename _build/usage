# TittleMemo

## Why has this toy project

I found TiddlyWiki has excellent idea but it's too complex and its foothold is too large. So I create this. It's naive but enough for me and easy to adjust(obviously).

## How to use

Now it only support Windows, because I always write on it. There has two bat for different target

1. build_tm.bat: I write some short markdown and combine them into a self contained html
2. build_rumi.bat: Some related markdown will be a rumitation

## Under the hood

build_tm.bat is simple wrap of md2s.py, you can specify the markdown file in which direcotory and which modify in last one day will be convert to mds and combine with other mds into `tm?.html`. You can change how many days on arguments.

* createAllTopH: first screen
* createCata: each catalog like `lang` or `think` called by this
* createCard: each markdown render result(card) called by this

build_rumi is also simple wrap of md2html.py.

## rule and restrict

all the memo should like `tag-fname.md` or `fname_tag.md`, fname is also `id` in html, tag at least 2 char and only allow `[a-z0-9]` and also `tag` in html
